### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
  I felt like the labs in this unit were helpful. In particular, the weather labs really helped me to expand my  knowledge on API's and search bars. On the other hand I felt like there wasn't
  alot of information on mapping or using the API to get specific data. Since every API has different commands and langage difference I had a lot of challenge on collecting and showcasing
  different things. 
* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  If I had more time I would have focused more on my CSS. For this project in particular, I wanted to complete all the tasks, so I didn't spend much time on the user interface or HTML.
  If there was one feature I could add it would be the side bar. I had the likes and follow movie buttons already completed, but I just didn't have the time to finish making a
  side bar for the project. 
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
  I was really happy this time that I was able to reach all my goals. I was able to focus more and learn what to do and what not to do. I started getting into the groove of things more
  abnd knowing different commands and how to use dev tools. I was able to have some really amazing 1:1 with my manager which really helped me fixed out kinks and bugs in my code, and
  I was able to learn ALOT more. I learnt how to use alot of different tools for this project which was really fascinating. 
### Open-source libraries used
I didn't use any.
### Shout out
I want to shout out Aneesa because I did a lot of brainstorming with her and bouncing off ideas, it was really nice to talk.
